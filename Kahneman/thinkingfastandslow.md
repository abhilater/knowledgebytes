Thinking fast and slow
=======================

Main Ideas
===========

1) There are 2 "thinking systems" in our minds. The first is fast, automatic. The second is slow, logical.

2) Anchoring: when you lack sufficient data to guess the value of something, you tend to hover around a pre-offered number.

3) Availability: a sort of confirmation bias. We tend to believe unlikely things have a high chance of happening because we keep looking at news/media portraying them.

4)  Loss Aversion: if they have to risk, humans prefer not losing to winning. 

5) Framing: How you present a situation affects your interpretation and feelings. Essentialy looking at the glass half empty or half full.

6) Sunk Costs: people believe because they've already spent money/time on something, they might as well see it through or continue. That is a mistake. Past events can't determine your future course of action.﻿

Cognitive Biases: Peak-End Effect 
==================================
I've used Kahneman's “peak-end rule theory” in the dating game with incredible success. So I meet women on a date and I'm not much of conversationist. So It's no surprise that these woman are bored out of their mind because they don't find me interesting, I get nervous and don't know what to say. Now here comes the interesting part: I always make sure at the very end of the date to create a pleasurable and memorable experience, and the way I do that is by simply hugging them goodbye, giving them a little kiss and telling them I can't wait to see them again. And by god does this work, it doesn't matter how bad the duration of the date went because the women always remember how it ended. It builds confidence and sexual attraction and the women can't wait to hear from me again!

System1 and System2
===================
* System 1 is the automatic/sub-concious system, whereas System 2 is the more effortful/concious system.
* System 1 - It is the fast impulsive intuition/respone/reaction happening sub-conciously and involuntarily.
```
Reacting to a threat before conciously recognizing it
```
* System 2 - It is the slow logical and rational concious process response, requires cognitive effort/energy, occupy short term working memory and usually avoided/not deployed out of lazyness. Has final control but influenced by System 1 inputs.
```
This is your System1 talking, slow down and let your System2 take control
```

Attention and Effort
=====================
* Pupil dilating tasks, tasks that require mental effort
```
Law of least effort is operating here. He will think as little as possible
```
* Stroll tasks - We can simultaneously drive while making casual converstations
* Sprint task - We can't do double digit multiplications while driving in a busy traffic

The lazy controller
====================
* Flow state - We don't have to struggle to stay on the task for hours and it mental energy is utilized optimally
* Ego depeletions due to loss of glucose/energy, lazyness to use System 2.

Associative Machine (Priming)
=============================
* System1 responses being sub-concious can be primed linking the present with the recent past with expectations of the near future. eg. Team of judges more likely to accept parole after lunch

* It implies that System1 responses may not be free will responses.
* Physical sensations are not just emotinal response/effects but also causes to emotional and furture physical effects.
```
I made myself smile and I'm actually feeling better.

They were primed to find flaws, and this is exactly what they found.
```

Cognitive Ease
===============
* Exposure effect - Familiarity breeds liking
```We must be inclined to believe it because it has been repeated so often, but lets think it through again```
* Good mood, intuition, creativity, gullibility and increased reliance of System1 form one cluter, whereas sadness, vigilance, suspicion and analytic approach and System2 forms the other cluster
```I'm in a good mood and my System2 is weaker than usual, I should be extra careful ```

Answering an easier question
============================
Instead of exerting mental effort and deploying System 2 to answer a difficult question we generally substitute it with an easy question and answer it instead
```The question we face is that whether this candidate will succeed, the question we seem to answer is whether she interviews well. Let's not substitute```

**Halo Effect** We seem to judge things quickly based on initial impressions and we then then to mold our subsequent judgements to conform our intial impression.
