Thinking fast and slow
=======================

Main Ideas
===========

1) There are 2 "thinking systems" in our minds. The first is fast, automatic. The second is slow, logical.

2) Anchoring: when you lack sufficient data to guess the value of something, you tend to hover around a pre-offered number.

3) Availability: a sort of confirmation bias. We tend to believe unlikely things have a high chance of happening because we keep looking at news/media portraying them.

4)  Loss Aversion: if they have to risk, humans prefer not losing to winning. 

5) Framing: How you present a situation affects your interpretation and feelings. Essentialy looking at the glass half empty or half full.

6) Sunk Costs: people believe because they've already spent money/time on something, they might as well see it through or continue. That is a mistake. Past events can't determine your future course of action.﻿

Cognitive Biases: Peak-End Effect 
==================================
I've used Kahneman's “peak-end rule theory” in the dating game with incredible success. So I meet women on a date and I'm not much of conversationist. So It's no surprise that these woman are bored out of their mind because they don't find me interesting, I get nervous and don't know what to say. Now here comes the interesting part: I always make sure at the very end of the date to create a pleasurable and memorable experience, and the way I do that is by simply hugging them goodbye, giving them a little kiss and telling them I can't wait to see them again. And by god does this work, it doesn't matter how bad the duration of the date went because the women always remember how it ended. It builds confidence and sexual attraction and the women can't wait to hear from me again!
