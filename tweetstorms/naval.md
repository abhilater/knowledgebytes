Looking forward to holidays takes the joy out of the everyday.
So true, grinding everyday in order to enjoy two weeks off that grind is toxic. I tried a pre-holiday to wind down, did work. But adjusting my work life so i would never long for the transition to holiday season again was my best decision.

### Decisions
Decisions:
• If you can’t decide, the answer is no.
• If two equally difficult paths, choose the one more painful in the short term (pain avoidance is creating an illusion of equality).
• Choose the path that leaves you more equanimous in the long term.

### How do you get rid of the negative thoughts in your head and focus on the +ve things?
Positive creates negative, eventually. Go beyond judgment and see how it feels.

### Would you mind sharing your meditation practice?
Sit and make no effort, surrender, and accept whatever happens. 1 hour at waking and 30-60m in the early evening. 60 days for real effect. YMMV.

### How do you lead without creating resentment?
By example
