1. Be Proactive - Focus on the things you can control rather than things you can't.
2. Begin with the end in mind - Are you doing things you want to be remembered as.
3. Put first things first - what we say vs how we allocate our time.
4. Think win win - For you to win they do not have to lose.
5. Seek first to understand then to be understood - Does what you do offer value?
6. Synergy - You can do more than just by yourself.
7. Sharpen the Saw - Go the long way even if it takes time.
