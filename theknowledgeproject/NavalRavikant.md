# The Knowledge Project with Naval Ravikant 

### Typical Day

There are days where I just work completely from home. There are days that I don’t work. 
I’m actually even trying to get **rid of this concept of having to be in a specific place at a 
specic time**. All I care about is am I doing what I want to do and am I being productive and am I happy. 
I really want to break away from this idea of 40 hour weeks, or 60 hour weeks, or 80 hour weeks, 
or 9-to-5, or roles, or jobs, or identities. It just all feels like a straitjacket

### Books

I don’t know about you, but I have very poor attention. **I skim. I speed read. I jump around**. 
I could not tell you specific passages or quotes from books. At some deep level, you do absorb 
them and they become part of the threads of the tapestry of your psyche

I read **Seven Brief Lessons On Physic**s. I’ve read that one at least twice. I’m rereading **Sapiens** again, 
because I love that book so much. I’m pretty much always rereading something by either **J. Krishnamurti 
or Osho**. Those are my favorite philosophers

I’ve got **Delusion Damage**, which is this blog I used to love. I’ve got pieces of it saved up. **Alan Watts. 
Scott Adams**

**Complete list**

### Blogs

I started reading less books and more blogs. Great blogs, like **Farnam Street** or **Kevin Simler’s blog, 
Melting Asphalt**, and so on, you get incredibly smart people digestifying, simplifying, and writing these 
great things,

Then with the Kindle and the iBooks coming along, that allowed me to start treating books like I treat blogs. 
When I go to blog, I’ll actually skim through lots of articles until I find one that looks really 
interesting and then I’ll read that whole article all the way through and maybe take notes. 

Now I treat books the same way. **I’ll skim through a large number of books. I’ll put them down. 
I’ll jump around, back, forward, middle, until I find a part that’s interesting. Then I’ll just consume 
that piece. I won’t feeling guilty about having to finish the entire book**.
I just view it as a blog archive. A blog might have 300 posts on it and you could read just the two, three,  
ve that you need right now. I think you can think of a book the same way. 

**It almost doesn’t matter what you read**. Eventually you will read enough things, and your interests
will lead your there, that it will dramatically improve your life. Just like the best workout for
you is the one that you’re excited enough to do every day, the same way I would say the books
or blogs or Twitter or whatever, anything with ideas and information and learning, the best ones
to read are the ones that you’re excited about reading all the time.


### Habits

A big habit the I’m working on, but I’m trying to **turn off my monkey mind**. I think, when we’re born 
as children, we’re pretty blank slates. We’re living very much in the moment. We’re essentially just
reacting to our environment through our instincts. We’re living in, what I would call the “real world.”
When **puberty comes along, that’s the onsetof desire, it’s the first time you really, really want something
and you start long-range planning for it. Because of that, you start thinking a lot and start building an
identity and an ego to go and get what you want.**

**This is all normal and healthy. It’s part of being the human animal**. I think at some point it gets out
of control and then we are constantly talking to ourselves in our head. We’re playing little movies in
our heads, walking down the street, but no one’s actually there. Of course, if we started voicing this
thought in your head that you’re always having, you’d be a madman and they’d lock you up.

The reality is if you walk down the street and **there are a thousand people
in the street, I think all thousand are talking to themselves in their head** at any given point. 
They’re constantly judging everything that they see. They’re playing back movies of things 
that happened to them yesterday. They’re living in fantasy worlds of what’s going to happen tomorrow. 
They’re just pulled out of base reality.

That could be **good when you’re doing long-range planning. It can be good when you’re solving problems.**
It’s good for the survival and replication machines that we are. I think **it’s actually very bad for 
your happiness**. In my mind, the mind should be a servant and a tool, not a master. It’s not something 
that should be controlling me and driving me 24/7.

I’m deliberately cultivating experiences, states of mind, locations, activities, that will help 
me get out of my mind.
All of society does that to some extent. In some sense, the **people chasing thrills in action sports 
or flow states or orgasm or any of these states that people really strive to get to, a lot of these
are basically just trying to get out of your own head**. They’re trying to get away from that voice in
your head and this overdeveloped sense of self. At the very least, I do not want my sense of self to
continue to develop and become stronger as I get older. I want it to be weaker and more muted so that
I can live much more in present every day reality and accept nature and the world for what it is and
appreciate it very much as a child would. Then not have to seek happiness through external circumstances,
chasing the  ts of preconceived notion that I have.

I’m 43 now. I don’t think I can make it through a single glass of wine without having some negative
consequence build up. I still drink. **I don’t believe in the words like never and always. I think
that’s a way of limiting yourself and self-disciplining yourself. It makes me less free and less
happy at some level**. I just want to be naturally in a position where I don’t need it and I don’t
desire it. That’s kind of what I’ve been working more on.


#### What habit would you say most positively impacts your life?

I think it’s the **daily morning workout. That has been a complete game- changer.**
It’s made me feel healthier, younger. It’s made me not go out late. It came from
one simple thing, which is everybody says, “I don’t have time.” Basically whenever
you throw any so-called good habit at somebody, they’ll have an excuse for themselves. 
Usually the most common is, I don’t have time. I don’t have time is just another way of
saying, it’s not a priority. What you really have to do is say is it a priority or not. 
If something is your number one priority then you will get it. That’s just the way life works. 
If you’ve got a fuzzy basket of 10 or 15 different priorities, you’re going to end up getting none of them.

What I did there was I basically just said, **“My number one priority in life, above my happiness,
above my family, above my work, is my own health. It starts with my physical health.” 
Second, it’s my mental health. Third, it’s my spiritual health. Then it’s my family’s health.
Then it’s my family’s wellbeing. After that, I can go out and do whatever I need to do with
the rest of the world.**

There’s a series of concentric circles starting out from me. Because my physical health became 
my number one priority, then I could never say I don’t have time. In the morning, I work out 
and however long it takes is how longit takes. I do not start my day, and I don’t care if the world
is imploding and melting down, it can wait another 30 minutes until I’m done working out.
