Typical Day
=================

There are days where I just work completely from home. There are days that I don’t work. 
I’m actually even trying to get **rid of this concept of having to be in a specific place at a 
specic time**. All I care about is am I doing what I want to do and am I being productive and am I happy. 
I really want to break away from this idea of 40 hour weeks, or 60 hour weeks, or 80 hour weeks, 
or 9-to-5, or roles, or jobs, or identities. It just all feels like a straitjacket

Books
=================

I don’t know about you, but I have very poor attention. **I skim. I speed read. I jump around**. 
I could not tell you specific passages or quotes from books. At some deep level, you do absorb 
them and they become part of the threads of the tapestry of your psyche

I read **Seven Brief Lessons On Physic**s. I’ve read that one at least twice. I’m rereading **Sapiens** again, 
because I love that book so much. I’m pretty much always rereading something by either **J. Krishnamurti 
or Osho**. Those are my favorite philosophers

I’ve got **Delusion Damage**, which is this blog I used to love. I’ve got pieces of it saved up. **Alan Watts. 
Scott Adams**

About Blogs
=================

I started reading less books and more blogs. Great blogs, like **Farnam Street** or **Kevin Simler’s blog, 
Melting Asphalt**, and so on, you get incredibly smart people digestifying, simplifying, and writing these 
great things,

Then with the Kindle and the iBooks coming along, that allowed me to start treating books like I treat blogs. 
When I go to blog, I’ll actually skim through lots of articles until I find one that looks really 
interesting and then I’ll read that whole article all the way through and maybe take notes. 

Now I treat books the same way. **I’ll skim through a large number of books. I’ll put them down. 
I’ll jump around, back, forward, middle, until I find a part that’s interesting. Then I’ll just consume 
that piece. I won’t feeling guilty about having to finish the entire book**.
I just view it as a blog archive. A blog might have 300 posts on it and you could read just the two, three,  
ve that you need right now. I think you can think of a book the same way. 

**It almost doesn’t matter what you read**. Eventually you will read enough things, and your interests
will lead your there, that it will dramatically improve your life. Just like the best workout for
you is the one that you’re excited enough to do every day, the same way I would say the books
or blogs or Twitter or whatever, anything with ideas and information and learning, the best ones
to read are the ones that you’re excited about reading all the time.


About Habits
=================

A big habit the I’m working on, but I’m trying to **turn off my monkey mind**. I think, when we’re born 
as children, we’re pretty blank slates. We’re living very much in the moment. We’re essentially just
reacting to our environment through our instincts. We’re living in, what I would call the “real world.”
When **puberty comes along, that’s the onsetof desire, it’s the first time you really, really want something
and you start long-range planning for it. Because of that, you start thinking a lot and start building an
identity and an ego to go and get what you want.**

**This is all normal and healthy. It’s part of being the human animal**. I think at some point it gets out
of control and then we are constantly talking to ourselves in our head. We’re playing little movies in
our heads, walking down the street, but no one’s actually there. Of course, if we started voicing this
thought in your head that you’re always having, you’d be a madman and they’d lock you up.

The reality is if you walk down the street and **there are a thousand people
in the street, I think all thousand are talking to themselves in their head** at any given point. 
They’re constantly judging everything that they see. They’re playing back movies of things 
that happened to them yesterday. They’re living in fantasy worlds of what’s going to happen tomorrow. 
They’re just pulled out of base reality.

That could be **good when you’re doing long-range planning. It can be good when you’re solving problems.**
It’s good for the survival and replication machines that we are. I think **it’s actually very bad for 
your happiness**. In my mind, the mind should be a servant and a tool, not a master. It’s not something 
that should be controlling me and driving me 24/7.

I’m deliberately cultivating experiences, states of mind, locations, activities, that will help 
me get out of my mind.
All of society does that to some extent. In some sense, the **people chasing thrills in action sports 
or flow states or orgasm or any of these states that people really strive to get to, a lot of these
are basically just trying to get out of your own head**. They’re trying to get away from that voice in
your head and this overdeveloped sense of self. At the very least, I do not want my sense of self to
continue to develop and become stronger as I get older. I want it to be weaker and more muted so that
I can live much more in present every day reality and accept nature and the world for what it is and
appreciate it very much as a child would. Then not have to seek happiness through external circumstances,
chasing the  ts of preconceived notion that I have.

I’m 43 now. I don’t think I can make it through a single glass of wine without having some negative
consequence build up. I still drink. **I don’t believe in the words like never and always. I think
that’s a way of limiting yourself and self-disciplining yourself. It makes me less free and less
happy at some level**. I just want to be naturally in a position where I don’t need it and I don’t
desire it. That’s kind of what I’ve been working more on.


#### What habit would you say most positively impacts your life?

I think it’s the **daily morning workout. That has been a complete game- changer.**
It’s made me feel healthier, younger. It’s made me not go out late. It came from
one simple thing, which is everybody says, “I don’t have time.” Basically whenever
you throw any so-called good habit at somebody, they’ll have an excuse for themselves. 
Usually the most common is, I don’t have time. I don’t have time is just another way of
saying, it’s not a priority. What you really have to do is say is it a priority or not. 
If something is your number one priority then you will get it. That’s just the way life works. 
If you’ve got a fuzzy basket of 10 or 15 different priorities, you’re going to end up getting none of them.

What I did there was I basically just said, **“My number one priority in life, above my happiness,
above my family, above my work, is my own health. It starts with my physical health.” 
Second, it’s my mental health. Third, it’s my spiritual health. Then it’s my family’s health.
Then it’s my family’s wellbeing. After that, I can go out and do whatever I need to do with
the rest of the world.**

There’s a series of concentric circles starting out from me. Because my physical health became 
my number one priority, then I could never say I don’t have time. In the morning, I work out 
and however long it takes is how longit takes. I do not start my day, and I don’t care if the world
is imploding and melting down, it can wait another 30 minutes until I’m done working out.


Happiness
=================

Today, I believe that happiness is, **it’s really a default state. It’s what’s there when you remove the sense that something is missing in your life**. We are highly judgmental, survival, and replication machines. We are constantly walking around thinking I need this, I need that, trapped in the web of desires. **Happiness is that state when nothing is missing. When nothing is missing, your mind shuts down and your mind stops running into the future or running into the past to regret something or to plan something.**

In that absence for a moment, you have internal silence. When you have internal silence, then you are content and you are happy. Feel free to disagree, again, it’s different for everybody, but people believe mistakenly that happiness is about positive thoughts and positive actions.

The more I’ve read, the more I’ve learned, the more I’ve experienced, because I verify this for myself, **every positive thought essentially holds within it a negative thought**. It is a contrast to something negative. The Tao Te Ching says this more articulately than I ever could, but it’s all **duality and polarity**.
**If I say I’m happy, that means that I was sad at some point. If I say he’s attractive, then that means that somebody else is unattractive. Every positive thought even has a seed of a negative thought within it and vice versa, which is why a lot of greatness in life comes out suffering**. You have to view the negative before you can aspire to and then appreciate the positive.

All of that said, long winded, to me **happiness is not about positive thoughts. It’s not about negative thoughts. It’s about the absence of desire, especially the absence of desire for external things. The fewer desires I can have, the more I can accept the current state of things, the less my mind is moving because the mind really exists in motion towards the future or the past. The more present I am, the happier and more content I will be. If I latch onto that, if I say, “Oh, I’m happy now”, and I want to stay happy, then I’m going to drop out of that happiness. Now, suddenly, the mind is moving. It’s trying to attach to something. It’s trying to create a permanent situation out of a temporary situation.**

**Happiness to me is mainly not suffering, not desiring, not thinking too much about the future or the past, really embracing the present moment and the reality of what is, the way it is. Nature has no concept of happiness or unhappiness. To a tree, there is no right or wrong. There is no good or bad.**

Nature follows unbroken mathematical laws and a chain of cause and effect from the big bang to now. Everything is perfect exactly the way it is. It is only in our particular minds that we’re unhappy or not happy and things are perfect or imperfect because of what we desire.
**I’ve also come to believe in the complete and utter insignificance of the self**, and I think that helps a lot. For example, if you thought you were the most important thing in the universe, then you would have to bend the entire universe to your will. If you’re the most important thing in the universe, then how could it not conform to your desires. If it doesn’t conform to your desires, something is wrong. However, if you view yourself as a bacteria or an amoeba or if you view all of your works as writing on water or building castles in the sand, then you have no expectation from how life should actually be. Life is just the way it is. Then you accept that and you have no cause to be happy or unhappy. Those things almost don’t apply.

What you’re left with in that neutral state is not neutrality. I think people think, “Oh, that would be a very bland existence.” No, this is the existence that little children live. If you look at little children, on balance, they’re generally pretty happy because they are really immersed into the environment and the moment without any thought of how it should be given their personal preferences and desires. I think the neutral state is actually a perfection state. One can be very happy as long as one isn’t too caught up in their own heads.


Internal Monologue
=================

I try to keep an eye on my internal monologue. It doesn’t always work. In the computer programming sense, I try to run my brain in debugging mode as much as possible. When I’m talking to someone, **like I’m talking to you right now, or when I’m engaged in a group activity, it’s almost impossible because your brain has too many things to handle. If I’m by myself, like just this morning, I’m brushing my teeth and I start thinking forward to the podcast.**

I started going through this little fantasy where I imagined you asking me a bunch of questions and I was **fantasy answering them. Then I caught myself. I put my brain in debug mode** and just watched every little instruction go by.
I said, “Why am I fantasy future planning? Why can’t I just stand here and brush my teeth?” It’s the awareness that my brain was running off in the future and planning some fantasy scenario out of ego. I was like, “Well, do I really care if I embarrass myself on Shane’s podcast? Who cares? I’m going to die anyway. This is all going to go to zero and I won’t remember anything, so this is pointless.”
At that point, I shut down and I went back to brushing my teeth. Then I was noticing how good the toothbrush was and how good it felt. Then the next moment I’m off to thinking something else. I have to look at my brain again and say, “Do I really need to solve this problem right now?”

**The reality is that 95% of what my brain runs off and tries to do, I don’t need to tackle at that exact moment. In fact, if it’s like a muscle, then I’ll be better off resting it and being at peace and then when a particular problem arises, immerse myself in it. What I would rather dedicate myself to is, for example, right now as we’re talking, to be completely lost in the conversation and to be 100% focused on this as opposed to thinking about, “Oh, when I brushed my teeth, did I do it the right way?” or planning something else in my mind**. I think the ability is to singularly focus is related to the ability to lose yourself and be present, happy, and actually, ironically, more effective.
